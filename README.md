# Cafe-and-CoffeeShop-sample
In order to better understand HTML & CSS and JavaScript, I created a copy of Prototype in Figma based on the sample images before coding.
-Slider
-Tabbing
-Embedding short videos
-Responsive coding
-Favicon settings, etc.

I'm proud of my hard work.
The next portfolio will be ready soon.
It's evolving even more (lol).
I can't wait to work on it.
Looking back on what I have created this time, I reconfirmed the reality that my skills and knowledge are still not enough.
Learning and mastering is fun!
